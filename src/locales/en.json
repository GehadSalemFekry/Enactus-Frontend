    "wood-details": "Recently, Egypt witnessed an explosive growth in its population resulting in a sharp increase in slums allover the country, which prevents people from buying good quality wood products or force them to abandon these products altogether. We solved this problem by introducing our project, which uses the used wood as a base for stylish products that satisfy the safety, practicality and environmental responsibilities issues, while maintaining a moderate price policy. This project targets those unemployed individuals living in slums who lack the opportunity to improve their financial situation through decent jobs, while taking all of this into consideration, we ENACTUS team of Alexandria University took it onto ourselves to help those people by training a segment of them from bab_alabed to produce decently made wood products - accessories, desks decoration, and so on- from the upcycled wood. This training regime also contains the ways of the market pertaining to marketing, sales chains, problem analysis.... Etc.",
